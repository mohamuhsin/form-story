# Form Story

Forms are great for collecting information on users, like job applications or insightful surveys. However, we can also stretch our creative muscles and have a little fun with forms. For this project, we’ll use our knowledge of the HTML <form> and grab user input to put a spin on a classic story!

The logic for parsing and inserting of user inputs is already taken care of in main.js using JavaScript . We’ve also added some styling to the page in style.css. 

What you have to do is now make a <form> capable of collecting the correct information so that the newly crafted story makes sense!

# Tasks

### Adding The Form

**1.** We’ll be collecting information from our users using a <form> so, first, we have to add a <form> under the <hr> element inside the <body> of index.html.

**2.** Assign the <form> an action of "story.html" and a method of "GET".

We’ll be sending information from our form to story.html using a GET request.
